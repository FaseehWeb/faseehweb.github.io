    <p>This is a simple Python Tkinter application that can encrypt and decrypt all types of files. When you encrypt a file, the program generates a key file with the same name, and you have to place the key file in the same directory where the encrypted file is located in order to decrypt the file.</p>

    <h2>What's in the Latest Update</h2>
    <h3>The latest update fixed the following bugs:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The program now automatically identifies the key file and will not encrypt it if it's a key file.</li>
        <li>Previously, the program displayed "is selected" when we clicked the file explorer button but didn't select any files. Now, the program correctly shows "no file selected."</li>
        <li>The program used to show "encrypt" in the action button even though no file was selected. Now, the action button displays "-" if no files are selected or if the action can't be done.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Improvements made in the latest version:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Improved the quality of error messages.</li>
        <li>Removed the label that showed the file path, as it felt complicated (I want this app to be simple).</li>
    </ol>
